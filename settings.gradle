/*
 * This settings_delete file was auto generated by the Gradle buildInit task
 * by 'arun' at '06/03/19 16:08' with Gradle 2.8
 *
 * Use of init will create skeleton build and settings_delete files which can be customized.
 * 	This allows a version of Gradle to be locked to a project, and afterwards you can use ./gradlew (or gradlew.bat on Windows) instead of gradle.
 *
 * The settings_delete file is used to specify which projects to include in your build.
 * In a single project build this file can be empty or even removed.
 *
 * Detailed information about configuring a multi-project build in Gradle can be found
 * in the user guide at https://docs.gradle.org/2.8/userguide/multi_project_builds.html
